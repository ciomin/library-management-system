<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Library Management System Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/ciomin/library-management-system)

This Library Management System is a tool designed to manage and streamline the organization of a library's resources. Developed with C, the system features dynamic memory allocation, which ensures efficient management of memory for operations that deal with a variable number of books. Users can interact with a user-friendly menu-driven interface to add, modify, or remove book entries in the database, which are stored in a binary file format.

Key functionalities include searching for books by various attributes like ID, name, author, or year; sorting books based on these attributes in both ascending and descending order; and user authentication features for secure access to the systemâ€™s editing capabilities. The system also supports password management, allowing users to reset or change their passwords as needed.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

From the main menu, users can choose to either "View" or "Edit" the library's database. Selecting "Edit" accesses the ADMINISTRATOR dashboard, which is secured by a LOGIN screen.

### View Menu
Users can search for books by NAME, AUTHOR, GENRE, or YEAR PUBLISHED. It is also possible to sort the book entries by ID, NAME, AUTHOR, GENRE, or YEAR PUBLISHED in either ASCENDING or DESCENDING order.

### Sort Menu
Here is an example of sorting books by GENRE in ASCENDING order:

### Login Screen
The authentication system is designed for simplicity; hence, the password will automatically reset to `admin` after three unsuccessful login attempts.

### Administrator Panel
Administrators have the ability to ADD, EDIT, or REMOVE entries from the database. All data is securely stored in binary file format.
